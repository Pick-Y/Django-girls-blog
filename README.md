#Create a virtual environment
Creating a virtual environment is helpful as it isolates all the dependencie in a project so that those dependencies would live in that project and it will avoid python versions conflict

-steps to create a virtual environemnt:
1. create a folder that is going to contain your project (in this case I used the name Django)
2. CD in that folder and run this command: 'python3 -m venv myvenv' ('myenv' is the name of the virtual environment)
In your project, now, you have a folder called myenv.
